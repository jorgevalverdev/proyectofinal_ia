The Republican-led House passed legislation to block future administrations from enacting bans on oil and gas drilling without congressional approval. 

In a vote on Friday, lawmakers passed the "Protecting American Energy Production Act" to prohibit the president from "declaring a moratorium on the use of hydraulic fracturing unless Congress authorizes the moratorium."

There were 118 Democrats who voted against the legislation, while Republican House members unanimously voted in favor of its passage.

The bill comes after former President Joe Biden enacted several regulations on oil and gas during his term, including banning future oil and gas drilling along 625 million acres of coastal and offshore waters just weeks before he left office.
